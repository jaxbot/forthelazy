# For the lazy

A series of coding references/tutorials I've been working on, as a bit of a introduction for people who know basic coding, but are otherwise too lazy to read through documentation or full tutorials on how to use a language.

Thus, these are basic reference sheets that provide detail on basic everyday usage of languages (and other things).

Early work in progress.
